		<h2><a href="#" class="scroll-link" data-id="story">Our Story</a></h2>

		<div class="two-col">
			<p>Sara and Trevor met during winter quarter of their freshman year at the University of Washington in 2009, in Spanish class. Conversation was stifled due to their poor Spanish skills, but when they found themselves in the same International Studies class the following quarter, they sat together and became friends. She noticed his unguarded smile, quick wit, and easygoing charm. He was won over by her generous laugh, sharp intellect, and her willingness to embark on adventures.</p>

			<p>Their friendship developed over fresh cookies on Friday afternoons, camping on the coast, and dinner parties with a growing group of shared friends. Finally (in Sara’s opinion), in November, Trevor told her that he liked her. They went on their first date that Sunday afternoon, on November 15, 2009. They walked through Pike Place Market, sipped tea, found a discarded bouquet of dried flowers, contributed to the gum wall, and left holding hands.</p>

			<p>Soon thereafter, the spirit of the holiday season inspired them to introduce each other to their families. At the time, Sara and Trevor didn’t realize how fortunate it was that Trevor and Sara’s mom, Robin, had the opportunity to get to know each other.</p>

			<p>Over the next five years, they fell in love over drinking endless cups of coffee; biking around town and out of town on many adventures; playing with their cat, Zeppelin; cooking and brewing various foods and beverages; hiking and camping in the Cascades and the Olympics; and sharing laughter with their beloved friends and family. Last spring, Sara and Trevor both graduated from UW with four degrees and a minor between them. Trevor is now working as a statistician on education research, and Sara is studying speech-language pathology at UW.</p>

			<p>This October, just shy of their five-year anniversary, Trevor and Sara spent a weekend in their favorite place, Friday Harbor, on San Juan Island, where they visit at least once a year. On October 11, they went out to dinner at a fancy restaurant and wore fancy clothes, and afterward took a walk toward the harbor and stopped to look at the water from beneath the tree at the entrance to town. Then Trevor suddenly darted into the bushes, pulled out the dried flowers from their first date, which he had surreptitiously hidden before dinner, and asked Sara to marry him. She was so surprised and happy that she doesn’t remember exactly what she said, but she’s certain it included the word “yes.”</p>
